# Contributing to the book

This is quite an opinionated book of how the authors see the development of
packages in this specific framework. Despiste being quite opinionated we are
happy to encourage people to contribute to the book and open issues.

This outlines how to propose a change to the book. 

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in the book may be present. We encourange 
people to open an issue to report it or a pull request to fix them.

### New sections

Although the book tries to cover the essential points, we may be missing some
crucial steps. We are happy to include new chapters and sections to this 
book if relevant. Please open always an issue to discuss with the authors to 
see if your point is within the scope of the book. We encourage users to take a
look to current open issues and pull request to ensure there is no overlap.

### Propose changes

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that the proposaed change is agreeable.
We are not closed to discuss and modify parts of the book, but most of the
sections are a consensus after some time of discussion.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  The new text should follow the structure of the current one.
