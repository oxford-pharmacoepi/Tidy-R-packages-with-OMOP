# Documenting code

Documenting code it is also important, after some weeks we will probably remember why you added some lines of code or what was needed next. Adding notes for yourself or the rest of developers it is always a good idea.

## When to document?

In general not all the lines of code need to be documented, a very simple example can be:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y <- x + 1
```

You do not need a comment to know that the value of `y` is going to be `x` plus one unit. But maybe you need to document why you did that for example when we calculate duration it is `end - start + 1` as we want to calculate the number of days (start and end are included) and not the difference (`end - start`). This might not be obvious at first glance and giving a clue to you in the future or any other developer will save you time:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# end and start are included in duration, we want number of days not difference
duration <- end - start + 1
```
