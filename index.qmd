This is an **opinionated** book on how we develop packages in the omopverse.

R packages

For general R package development we recommend the following book: [R Packages; Learn how to create a package, the fundamental unit of shareable, reusable, and reproducible R code](https://r-pkgs.org).

The book is divided in four parts:

-   **Part one**: covers the main ...

-   **Part two**: covers the main ...

-   **Part three**: covers the main ...

-   **Part four**: covers the main ...

-   **Part five**: covers the main ...
