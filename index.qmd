This is an **opinionated** book on how we develop packages in the omopverse.

R packages

For general R package development we recommend the following book: [R Packages; Learn how to create a package, the fundamental unit of shareable, reusable, and reproducible R code](https://r-pkgs.org).

The book is divided in four parts:

- **Part one**: covers the main ...
- **Part two**: covers the main ...
- **Part three**: covers the main ...
- **Part four**: covers the main ...
- **Part five**: covers the main ...

    -   scope
    -   how it fits within the ecosystem
-   classes (they are deffined in omopgenerics)
-   error messages
    -   Why?
